        <h1>More Cache Than You</h1>

        There are a dizzying array of bad "cache" puns to be made, and while I'm
blogging about my pyblosxom cache, I'll try and use them all.<p>
Surprisingly, today I got quite a bit of work done after Thanksgiving dinner on
the pyblosxom cache I've been working on. First, I altered it to use multiple
files which mirror the datadir, just like the meta plugin does. Second, I
altered it to lock the files it's using; I need to go back and do that for the
meta plugin.
It was nice to see that a file locking mechanism had already been built into
Pyblosxom.tools; it saved me quite a bit of work having to dig one up. Finally,
I documented my code as it comes closer to release.<p>
What I'm going to write about, though, is the big change I made: I moved the
caching code into pyblosxom.py. I don't believe that it's possible to fully
accomplish what I want it to accomplish as a plugin. If the filelist_cache were
a plugin, and another plugin implemented the filelist callback, I could not
guarantee that the cache's callback would be called first. This is a problem,
since it means that I can't check the cache before returning the data.<p>
Imagine, for example, that a user requests http://myblog/keyword/python . What
I want is for my cache to see if it has already searched for "keyword/python", so
that it can return it immediately if it has. However, since the keywords plugin
implements the filelist callback, it takes control of the request, and iterates
through the datadir, parsing every file. This is exactly what I want to
avoid.<p>
So my cache plugin needs to act <em>before</em> the filelist callback;
currently, this can only be implemented by changing the default pyblosxom
request handler. I will be submitting a patch for this in another couple of
days, but I'm not sure if the cache is general enough to justify its inclusion
in the default request handler.<p>
The reason that I think it may be worthwhile is the enormous benefit it seems
to provide. I tested the plugin on Linux and Windows today, and with a large
number of blogs, it's been providing a consistent speedup of 30%-50%. This
difference is really quite enormous in the scheme of things, and I think the
people who have large pyblosxom sites would see immediate benefits from this
change.
