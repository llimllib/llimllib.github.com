        <h1>Cache Money</h1>

        I've successfully implemented a new caching system for Pyblosxom. The one that
exists is confusing to me, and actually slowed pyblosxom performance in my
tests. Initial testing of my cache plugin shows a speedup of 10%-30%, depending
on the size and amount of the entries in the blog to be parsed.<p>
I've been testing the cache on Fedora Core 3 with Apache 2.0.52 and Python
2.3.4, and I've been using the <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a> testing program which I
mentioned before. JMeter has been set to have 2 threads bang away at the server
simultaneously for 50 repetitions each.<p>
With my cache plugin (Filecache) and a very large blog directory, (about 1000 entries
between 30 and 120 kilobytes each, ~47M total) the average request takes
about 1.7 seconds. Without the cache, that number jumps up to 2.15 or so. With
the included cache, that number stays around 2.15.<p>
Filecache works by implementing the filelist callback. It uses the request to
the pyblosxom server as a key into a big dictionary which maps requests to
filelists, which it stores in a file
specified by a configuration parameter. For example, if a user requests
http://example.com/pyblosxom.cgi/2004/Nov/12/test , the plugin looks in the
cache to see if "2004/Nov/12/test" has been cached. If it has, it loads the
filelist associated with that key and returns it. If it hasn't, it goes through
the normal filelist procedure, but at the end, it stores the filelist into the
cache.<p>
There is still a good deal of work to be done; for example, I have to figure
out when to refresh the cache. It could be done via a user command - for
example, whenever the user appends ?refreshCache=True to a page - or via a
timeout. Also, do I need to lock the cache file, so that two Apache threads
don't try to write to it at the same time? Should the cache be spread across
multiple files, like it is in the default caching mechanism? This could slow
access, but would also decrease memory usage.<p>
On the whole, though, I think that this should be a drop-in plugin which
increases the speed of your pyblosxom site 10%-30%. Hopefully I'll have it in a
state where it can be released in 2-3 days, but I don't know how much time I'll
have over the holiday weekend. Since it's only 96 lines, and probably 60 of
those are actually code, I don't think it should take me too long.
