        <h1>Imitating Sol LeWitt&#x27;s Wall Drawing #1136 in Javascript</h1>

        
<p><em>See the finished product <a
href="http://billmill.org/solving-sol/1136/llimllib/">here</a></em>

<p>Each of Sol LeWitt's "wall drawings" consists of a short set of
instructions, sometimes with an accompanying diagram, that instructs the
"owner" on  how to implement the work; Sol usually did not execute his own
work, but rather the "art" consisted in the concept. Here is an example
instruction:

<p>A few years ago, I found Brad Bouse's excellent <a
href="http://solvingsol.com/">Solving Sol</a> website, which asks users to
implement some of these wall drawings in the browser. I tried a few, and got
hooked because iplmenting a wall drawing was a pleasing, easy way to kill a few
hours.

<p>Here are my interpretations of wall drawing <a
href="http://billmill.org/solving-sol/011/llimllib/index.html">11</a>, <a
href="http://billmill.org/solving-sol/016/llimllib/index.html">16</a>, <a
href="http://billmill.org/solving-sol/046/llimllib/index.html">46</a>, <a
href="http://billmill.org/solving-sol/049/llimllib/index.html">49</a> and <a
href="http://billmill.org/solving-sol/130/llimllib/index.html">130</a>.

<p>Almost exactly one year ago today, I saw Wall Drawing 1136 and decided to
take it on. Here it is, as installed at the Tate Modern:

<p><a href="images/sol/lewitt_1136_tate.jpg"><img
src="images/sol/lewitt_1136_tate.jpg" width="700"></a>

<p>I thought that perhaps it would be a bit more difficult than the others I
had done, since I had to deal with an irregular curve instead of lines and
arcs, but I was unprepared for just how much of a pain it would prove to
be.

<h2>The Instructions</h2>

<p>There are several pictures of 1136 available on the web, but it's much
easier to work with the full instructions, as I had with the other LeWitts I
had done.

<p>Here is what the Tate <a
href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lewitt-wall-drawing-1136-ar00165/text-summary">has
to say</a> about the work:

<blockquote>A letter of instruction, an installation diagram and a certificate
pertaining to Wall Drawing #1136 can be found in Tate Gallery Records (PC10.1
LeWitt, Sol)... The diagram is a small colour inkjet print that lays out the
pattern of the wall drawing in one continuous elongated horizontal
band.</blockquote>

<p>I contacted the librarians at the Tate to ask if I could see the installation
diagram, but they declined and responded by emphasizing this portion of the
summary:

<p><blockquote>Please be advised that the documents are the signature for the Wall
Drawing and must accompany the Wall Drawing if it is sold or otherwise
transferred. They represent the transfer of ownership from the artist to you …
Under no circumstances will we issue a new certificate!</blockquote>

<p>To me, this suggests that the documents must accompany the sale of the
artwork, but not that showing me a copy would constitute a transfer of the
work. I am disappointed with the unwillingness of a public (albeit funded by a
government different than my own) institution to share information about the
artwork and skeptical that it would be actually damaging to anyone.

<p>It seemed that I would not be able to work with the official instructions, but
I carried on as best I could.

<p><em>(If anyone cares to go to the Tate Library and ask about seeing the
instructions, I would be forever grateful! Please <a
href="mailto:bill@billmill.org">drop me a line if you do</a>.)</em>

<h2>The Drawing</h2>

<p>The first step was simple but tedious: transcribe the color sequence of
equal width lines that make up the background of the work. In case anybody else
ever needs it, here is the sequence, where G is green, Y yellow, B blue, O
orange, R red, P purple, and E grey:

<p><pre>GYBOPERBYGERPGYBOERBGYPOBGRPEYBGOPYBERPOGBYPREOGYBOERPBYOPGEBRY
BEOPRGBEYRGPOBRGOYEBRGOPYBERGORBEYBOPGRBPEYBRPGOGBYEPORGEBPYRGO
PEYGPOREBYPGBROGYBR</pre>

<p>To generate this sequence and ensure it was correct, I simply opened an
image of the work in photoshop and annotated it with the text tool so that I
could check to avoid mistranslations.

<p>Next, however came the curve. Or, as I would find out, the 9 curves.

<p>I took the best image of 1136, which I've embedded above, cropped it and
fixed the perspective as best I could, creating a base image for tracing the
curve.

<p>I had hoped that I would be able to "cheat" by doing something clever like
tracing the curve once, then drawing it 9 times in different widths. I was
unfortunately never able to come up with a clever way to have different colors
on a curve in the way that this curve goes.

<p>Once I realized that I needed 9 curves, my naïve first guess was to just try
and trace one curve, then subtract a fixed amount from it to make the curve
above it. The <a
href="http://bl.ocks.org/llimllib/b7fce04e7d63427b5b3f91fae547223d">total
failure</a> of this method led me to the understanding that each of the 9
curves was in fact a different curve, and that perhaps I needed to understand a
bit more about bezier curve offsetting than I did.

<p><img src="images/sol/offset_fail.png"><br><em class="caption">fail.</em>

<p>I looked into bezier offsetting, and found a rich literature which I will
sum up by saying that it's <a
href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#offsetting">impossible in the general
case</a>, and possible but difficult to estimate in practice.

<p>After I implemented <a
href="http://bl.ocks.org/llimllib/8d7d571c3233e5cf711f6a6c1e28b5fb">a lousy
version</a> of the <a
href="http://math.stackexchange.com/a/467038/109164">Tiller-Hanson</a>
approximation algorithm, I was fortunate enough to find the <a
href="https://github.com/Pomax/bezierjs">bezier.js</a> library which was
capable of handling all the tricky bits for me.

<p>Finally I had the tools to set up <a
href="http://bl.ocks.org/llimllib/a436acd66740f978d73ce4261b4c3aa8">a shim for
tracing the curve</a>; go there and play around with the very slow control
point editor to get a feel for the slow, painful process of editing the curve
to match LeWitt.

<p>Once I got that looking as close as I felt like getting it, even though
there are still some srerious warts with the curve, I copied the paths out of
the SVG using the Chrome inspector, and used those as the magic paths <a
href="https://github.com/llimllib/solving-sol/blob/d822e18809731e6673cc2de796f32446712631b0/1136/llimllib/index.html#L113">you
can see in the source</a>.

<p><img src="images/sol/bug.png"><br><em class="caption">I cannot unsee this
bad join but I'm also not willing to fix it.</em>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This project took me much, much longer than I expected. I'm glad I got it
out eventually, even if all I can see are the ways it could be improved.

<p>I'm sure that some person would find an easy way to solve it! Like tracing
it in Illustractor or Inkscape and just using those curves; but I was unwilling
to use a drawing tool, and that unwillingness got me to learn some new
algorithms.

<p>I hope you like <a
href="http://billmill.org/solving-sol/1136/llimllib/">the piece</a>, and if
you're interested in doing a Sol, I highly recommend it. Go <a
href="https://github.com/wholepixel/solving-sol">check out the repo</a> and
have at it. Many of them can be completed in just an hour or two, but others
might lead you on a a bit of a journey.
