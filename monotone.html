        <h1>Image Programming in JavaScript: Converting to Monochrome</h1>

        
<p>In <a href="the_histogram.html">part 1</a> of this series, we looked at how
each pixel of an image is composed of three parts; red, green and blue, and
showed how to make histograms to give a summary of each. Towards the end, I 
showed that they can be averaged in different ways to create a single
histogram. In this article, we're going to look at the idea of mixing colors
in more depth and show how we can use it to turn color images into monochrome 
in a variety of ways.

<h2>Some Terminology</h2>

<p>In the last article, we talked about how each pixel is composed of a red,
a green, and a blue component, and how each of those has a value between 0 and
255. What I didn't tell you then was that it's often useful to consider just 
the red components of pixels in an image, just the green components, or just
the blue components.

<p><blockquote>A <em>channel</em> of an image I<sub>1</sub> is an image
I<sub>2</sub> composed entirely of one component of I<sub>1</sub></blockquote>

<p>So when we talk about the <em>red channel</em> of an image, we're talking
about the image that results from simply dropping the green and blue
components of each of its pixels. It's best to see it in action:

<p><img src="static/images/jump_r_g_b.jpg">

<p>The first image above can be entirely reconstructed from the last three 
monochrome images, using the first for the red channel, the second for the 
green channel, and the third for the blue. By the end of the article, we'll 
show the code for the <a href="/static/pixastic/demos/mono_demo.html">demo</a> 
that was used to convert the color image above into each of the monochrome 
ones.

<h2>Monochrome in Black and White</h2>

<p>Before we discuss converting a color image into monochrome, it will help to 
understand a bit more about what we mean by monochrome.

<p>Conceptually, we can consider each pixel of a monochrome image to consist of 
just one byte of information, instead of three bytes for red, green and blue as 
in a color image. This byte represents the brightness of a pixel, where 0 is 
black (no brightness) and 255 is white (no brightness). The values in between 
represent the grays, from the dark low numbers to the light high colors.

<p>Since monochrome images are composed of values other than (r, g, b), let's 
update the working definition of a digital image that we used last time:

<p><blockquote>A <em>Digital Image</em> is a sequence of pixels, each of which 
is composed of one or more <em>channels</em>. The value of each channel 
represents its strength in that pixel.</blockquote>

<p>So a monochrome image consists of only one channel, that representing the 
brightness of each pixel.

<h2>The Real World Intrudes</h2>

<p>We've got a nice new mental model of a monochrome image, but the real world, 
as it tends to do, will complicate matters. We're working with color images on 
the &lt;canvas&gt; element, which means that each pixel needs to be composed of 
red, green, and blue. In order to display a monochrome image on a 
&lt;canvas&gt;, we'll need to convert each pixel from one channel, brightness,
to three.

<p>A convenient property of RGB images makes this transformation easy: any 
pixel made up of equal parts red, green, and blue will be gray. Therefore, to 
convert an image from monochrome to RGB, we simply use the brightness channel 
of each pixel in the monochrome image as all three channels in the RGB image.

<h2>Mixing it Up</h2>

<p>Reversing the process, to create monochrome images from color ones, offers 
us a few more options. For every pixel, our task is to take three channels and 
condense them into one. The obvious thing to do is to simply average them; and 
indeed, this is exactly what happens by default in most photo editing programs 
when you convert an image to monochrome.

<p>There's no reason that we need to limit ourselves to that transformation, 
though. We should consider other options because the average often produces 
flat, uninteresting pictures. Instead, we can mix the channels any way we want 
to produce the most interesting result possible.

<p>I've put up a <a href="/static/pixastic/demos/mono_demo.html">demo</a> where 
you can play with the mixture of colors. Simply put numbers into each of the 
three inputs at the bottom of the page and hit "desaturate" to create a 
monochrome image where the channels have been weighted proportionally to the 
numbers you've entered. The histogram below the desaturate button will show you 
the effects of your mix.

<p>Play with the values to find the result you find most pleasing, and notice
how different the images that result from each mix can be.

<h2>Show Me The Goods</h2>

<p>Here's the important parts of the code in the <a 
href="/static/pixastic/demos/mono_demo.html">demo</a>, with the fiddly bits 
stripped out:

<p><div class="highlight" style="background: #f0f0f0"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">function</span> desaturate(rweight, gweight, bweight) {
  <span style="color: #60a0b0; font-style: italic">//normalize the color weights</span>
  <span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">var</span> scale <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #40a070">1</span> <span style="color: #666666">/</span> (rweight <span style="color: #666666">+</span> gweight <span style="color: #666666">+</span> bweight);
  rweight <span style="color: #666666">*=</span> scale;
  gweight <span style="color: #666666">*=</span> scale;
  bweight <span style="color: #666666">*=</span> scale;

  each_pixel(image_data, <span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">function</span>(r, g, b) {
    <span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">var</span> brightness <span style="color: #666666">=</span> r <span style="color: #666666">*</span> rweight <span style="color: #666666">+</span> g <span style="color: #666666">*</span> gweight <span style="color: #666666">+</span> b <span style="color: #666666">*</span> bweight;

    <span style="color: #60a0b0; font-style: italic">//replace the r, g, and b values of the pixel with &quot;brightness&quot;</span>
    <span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">return</span> [brightness, brightness, brightness];
  });
}

<span style="color: #60a0b0; font-style: italic">//red channel only:</span>
desaturate(<span style="color: #40a070">1</span>, <span style="color: #40a070">0</span>, <span style="color: #40a070">0</span>);

<span style="color: #60a0b0; font-style: italic">//green channel only:</span>
desaturate(<span style="color: #40a070">0</span>, <span style="color: #40a070">1</span>, <span style="color: #40a070">0</span>);

<span style="color: #60a0b0; font-style: italic">//blue channel only:</span>
desaturate(<span style="color: #40a070">0</span>, <span style="color: #40a070">0</span>, <span style="color: #40a070">1</span>);

<span style="color: #60a0b0; font-style: italic">//my favorite mix:</span>
desaturate(<span style="color: #40a070">5</span>, <span style="color: #40a070">1</span>, <span style="color: #40a070">4</span>);
</pre></div>


<p>First we convert the color weights into percentages, then we multiply
each component of each pixel times its weight to arrive at a new value for the
pixel to take. Finally, we use the brightness value we've calculated as the 
value for all three channels to render the image in grayscale.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article, we've extended our definition of an image to include images 
with channels other than just red, green, and blue. We learned how to convert 
monochrome images for display in RGB, and looked at a couple different ways to 
convert back from RGB to monochrome. Finally, we looked at code to do the 
conversions we'd spent the whole article talking about.

<p>Hopefully you have a pretty good grasp on what an image on a &lt;canvas&gt; 
is by now. If you want to download the code for the demos I've shown so far and 
play with it, go ahead and <a
