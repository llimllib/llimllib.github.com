        <h1>Image Programming in JavaScript: The Histogram</h1>

        <p>Recently, I've spent a lot of my time <a 
href="http://flickr.com/photos/llimllib">taking photographs</a>. When I get 
home from taking pictures, I immediately pop open Lightroom to import the 
images, pick out my favorites, do some adjustments on them, and publish them.

<p>As a programmer, though, it was bothering me that I don't know 
<em>exactly</em> what's happening behind the scenes when I adjusted my images.  
What's <em>really</em> happening when I adjust the "saturation" slider for a 
photo?  How does sharpening work, and what does its "amount" mean?

<p>Sure, I could go read books to find out, but there's only way to really know 
what's happening: write a program to do it. This article represents part 1 of 
what will hopefully become a series on programming the digital image with 
JavaScript.

<h2>Wait, JavaScript?</h2>

<p>Sure thing! With the recent adoption of the &lt;canvas&gt; element into 
modern browsers, JavaScript has gained the ability to load, display, and 
manipulate images at the pixel level. In addition, Jacob Seidelin recently 
created the <a href="http://www.pixastic.com/">Pixastic</a> library to do the 
heavy DOM and canvas lifting for us.

<p>As much as possible, I'll be using Pixastic as a base because JavaScript is 
a reasonably enjoyable programming language, the framework is new and simple, 
and I can show neat demos right in the browser. I'll also be using <a 
href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, because it makes writing cross-browser 
JavaScript much more pleasant.

<h2>Jumping Right In: What Is a Digital Image?</h2>

<p>In the spirit of <acronym title="You Ain't Gonna Need It">YAGNI</acronym>, 
we're going to accept a superficial answer to this question, at least for now.  
We're basically going to pretend that all images are in color and represented 
in the same color space in the same way. Our provisional definition of a 
digital image is this:

<p><blockquote>A <em>Digital Image</em> is a sequence of pixels, each of which 
is represented by a 3-byte tuple (red, green, blue). The value of each element 
represents the strength of that color in that pixel.</blockquote>

<p>This means that each pixel has a value between 0 and 255, where 0 represents 
absence and 255 full strength. For example, the tuple (255, 0, 0) would 
represent a pure red pixel, the tuple (0, 255, 0) a pure green one, and (0, 0, 
255) a pure blue one.

<div style="float:right"><img src="/static/images/AdditiveColor.png"></div>

<p>Since we're mixing light<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>, the colors are <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color">additive</a>, which means 
that they get lighter when mixed. Thus (255, 255, 0) represents a mixture of 
red and green which produces yellow, (0, 255, 255) represents green and blue 
combined to form magenta, and so on as you can see in the chart to the right.

<p>You can think of it is as if you're in a dark room shining colored 
flashlights on a wall; if you don't shine any lights the wall remains black. If 
you shine all three colors on it, you get white. Thus, it makes sense that (0, 
0, 0) represents black and (255, 255, 255) represents white.

<h2>OK, I get it. So what's a Histogram?</h2>

<div style="float:right"><img src="/static/images/hist.png"></div>

<p>There are of course lots of colors in between the pure ones I talked about 
above, represented by the all the possible color tuples with values between 0 
and 255. In order to understand an image at a glance, it's often helpful to see 
just how often each color occurs in that image. The histogram allows us to do 
just that.

<p>To the right is the basic schematic of a histogram. The y-axis represents 
the frequency of each color value, which are represented on the x-axis. The 
left side of the histogram shows darker colors and the right side lighter.

<p><blockquote>The <em>histogram</em> of an image is a chart of how often each 
possible value or range of values for a color occurs in that image</blockquote>

<p>Below is an image next to the histograms for its red, green, and blue 
values, respectively.

<p><img src="/static/images/jump_hist.png">

<p>We can see that there are a lot of light blues, presumably in the the sky, a 
lot of midrange reds and greens, and not a whole lot of dark colors, though 
there is a spike at pure black. I won't go over what a histogram means for your 
photography; you should read what a <a 
href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/understanding-histograms.shtml">better 
photographer</a> has to say about that.

<h2>On To The Source</h2>

<p>There are 2 major steps in creating histograms: gathering the data and 
drawing the histogram. To gather the data, we'll initialize three arrays with 
256 slots, one array slot for each of the color values. Then we'll just loop 
through each pixel in the image and add one in the appropriate histogram slot 
for each color. That's it!

<p><div class="highlight" style="background: #f0f0f0"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">function</span> array256(default_value) {
  arr <span style="color: #666666">=</span> [];
  <span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">for</span> (<span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">var</span> i<span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #40a070">0</span>; i<span style="color: #666666">&lt;</span><span style="color: #40a070">256</span>; i<span style="color: #666666">++</span>) { arr[i] <span style="color: #666666">=</span> default_value; }
  <span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">return</span> arr;
}

<span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">var</span> rvals <span style="color: #666666">=</span> array256(<span style="color: #40a070">0</span>);
<span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">var</span> gvals <span style="color: #666666">=</span> array256(<span style="color: #40a070">0</span>);
<span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">var</span> bvals <span style="color: #666666">=</span> array256(<span style="color: #40a070">0</span>);

each_pixel(image_data, <span style="color: #007020; font-weight: bold">function</span>(r, g, b) {
  rvals[r]<span style="color: #666666">++</span>;
  gvals[g]<span style="color: #666666">++</span>;
  bvals[b]<span style="color: #666666">++</span>;
});
</pre></div>


<p>Where <code>each_pixel</code> is simply a function that loops through the 
image and passes the red, green, and blue value of each pixel of its first 
argument to the function passed as its second argument. What we have at the end 
of this code is three arrays, each containing the count of each possible value 
of one color in the image.

<p>To simplify the display of these histograms, we'll draw on a &lt;canvas&gt; 
256 pixels wide, so that each possible color occupies one pixel. Since our 
canvas is only 100 pixels tall, and any histogram value could be greater than 
100, we'll scale each value as the percentage of the maximum value in the 
histogram.

<p><div class="highlight" style="background: #f0f0f0"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #60a0b0; font-style: italic">//get a reference to the canvas to draw on</span>

  });
}

colorbars(rmax, rvals, <span style="color: #4070a0">&quot;rgb(255,0,0)&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #40a070">100</span>);

<p>You can see this code in action at the top half of the <a 
href="http://billmill.org/static/pixastic/demos/hist_demo.html">histogram demo 
page</a>. Note that the histograms on that page are being generated by
JavaScript when you load the page, so you can look into the source and
see exactly how the process works.

<h2>A Mean Feat</h2>

<p>Most of the time, the three histograms are more information than we need.  
Instead, we want to be able to tell at a glance whether we've overexposed or 
underexposed the shot, and a single histogram can give us all the information 
we need. In this case, all we need is an average of the three histograms.

<p>The obvious way to average the three histograms is to weight them all 
equally, sum each value, and divide by three. You'll see this histogram under 
"Average" on the <a 
href="http://billmill.org/static/pixastic/demos/hist_demo.html">demo page</a>.

<p>However, not all colors appear equally bright to human eyes, so the equally 
weighted histogram is commonly replaced with one more heavily weighted towards 
green, which appears brightest. A commonly given figure is 30% red, 59% green, 
and 11% blue, the results of which you can see in the "weighted average" 
histogram on the <a 
href="http://billmill.org/static/pixastic/demos/hist_demo.html">demo</a>.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully, this article lays a solid base on which I can begin building up 
to show more complex and interesting image transformations with JavaScript and 
Pixastic. It should have given you a basic understanding of how an image is 
formed and how to build several different types of histograms from it. For a 
more detailed understanding, I encourage you to study the code given in the 
demo page; it should all be pretty simple.
