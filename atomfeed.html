        <h1>New at billmill.org: Atom Feeds!</h1>

        <p>So, another day off yesterday meant another morning project: replacing the 
default Rss feed with an <a 
href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/">Atom</a> feed, fixing 
the appearance of source code in both feeds, and making them both validate.  
Perhaps I was prompt enough to avoid <a 
href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/05/29/unlucky-in-feeds#comments">Mark 
Pilgrim's wrath</a>.<p>

For the time being, I will support both feeds, but only give links to the Atom 
feed. Hopefully both will work better in the future, now that they have been 
vetted by the official authority of <a 
href="http://feedvalidator.org">feedvalidator.org</a>, which is quite slow but 
worth the wait.<p>
P.S. Mark's eyes only - <a 
href="http://billmill.org:9561/cherry_blossom/">Cherry Blossom</a> wouldn't 
give you invalid feeds...
