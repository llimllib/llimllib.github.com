        <h1>Battle of the Lightweight Python Templates</h1>

        I have a couple of requirements for my in-development photo gallery. First, I
want to have a limited number of pictures appear on each page of the gallery,
and to allow people to page through the pages of the gallery. Second, I don't
want to make the user count up how many photos are in each gallery page and
enter them into their config.py; the software should be smart enough to figure
that out.<p>
Unfortunately, these requirements together mean that it would be uncomfortable
to use the current pyblosxom templating system for the templates of my photo
gallery. To make it work, I would imagine that a gallery template would look
something like this:<p>
<textarea cols="60" rows="12"><div id="photos">
<a href="$base_url/$photo_trigger">Home</a><p>
<a href="$photo1_url"><img src="$thumb1"></a>
<a href="$photo2_url"><img src="$thumb2"></a>
<a href="$photo3_url"><img src="$thumb3"></a>
<br />
<a href="$photo4_url"><img src="$thumb4"></a>
<a href="$photo5_url"><img src="$thumb5"></a>
<a href="$photo6_url"><img src="$thumb6"></a>
<br />
<a href="$next_page">next</a><br>
<a href="$prev_page">previous</a>
</div></textarea><p>
I would then have to parse the template to pull index numbers from inside the
variable names and figure out how many photos were in the template, so that I
could show only that many pictures, as well as figure out if there's a next
page or not. Furthermore, I would have to append all variables associated with
a picture with that picture's index. In general, it would be really messy.<p>
To fix the issues with such a templating scheme, I came up with a template that
looked like this:<p>
<textarea cols="60" rows="12"><div id="photos">
<a href="$base_url/$photo_trigger">Home</a><p>
<photo><a href="$photo_url"><img src="$thumb"></a></photo>
<photo><a href="$photo_url"><img src="$thumb"></a></photo>
<photo><a href="$photo_url"><img src="$thumb"></a></photo>
<br />
<photo><a href="$photo_url"><img src="$thumb"></a></photo>
<photo><a href="$photo_url"><img src="$thumb"></a></photo>
<photo><a href="$photo_url"><img src="$thumb"></a></photo>
<br />
<a href="$next_page">next</a><br>
<a href="$prev_page">previous</a>
</div></textarea><p>
Now, each &lt;photo&gt; tag tells the gallery that it's in the "namespace" (to
use the term loosely) for
the next picture, obviating the need for index numbers on variables. I hacked
up a script to parse the template, count the photo tags, split up the sections
enclosed between <photo> tags, and do variable replacement on them with 
consecutive photoEntry dictionaries. This allowed me to use the pyblosxom
variable replacement algorithm for most of the heavy lifting, and the templates
looked OK.<p>
However, when I did this, I wasn't entirely satisfied. I remembered back in my
PHP days, that I would have done it differently. As you can see, there are 2
repeated rows of 3 photos each, with a &lt;br&gt; in between. Why not go
heavier on the template and allow looping? I figured there would be a few
python packages ready-made for this, and went hunting.<p>I found 2 right away in
the <a href="http://www.pythonweb.org/">Python Web Modules</a> -
<a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a> and 
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/162292">Xyaptu</a>.
I was more
immediately impressed with Xyaptu's syntax, but both looked easy enough, so I
gave them both a shot. I would have tried out Cheetah first, but a test page
like this:<p>
<textarea cols="60" rows="5"><html><head>$title</head><body>
This page has _${var}_ substitution.<br>
#for $i in $photos:
    $i.location
#end for
</body></html></textarea><p>
took over 2 seconds to parse. This was clearly unacceptable, as the gallery is
going to be rendering pages on the fly. I fiddled with Xyaptu for a while,
fixing it to my needs a little bit, and it was clearly much faster and simpler.
I decided to give it a shot,
so I went ahead and coded up the whole gallery page.
The Xyaptu template looked like this:<p>
<textarea cols="60" rows="14"><div id="photos">
<a href="$base_url/$photo_trigger">Home</a><p>
<py-line code="num_photos = 6" />
<py-line code="next_page = next(num_photos, len(photos), page, base_url, path_info)" />
<py-open code="for i in range(min(num_photos, len(photos))):" />
    <py-open code="if i and i%3 == 0:" />
        <br />
    <py-close />
    <a href="$base_url/$photo_trigger/${photos[(page*num_photos) + i]['photofile']}"><img src="${photos[i]['thumb']}"></a>
<py-close />
<br />
<a href="$next_page">next</a><br>
<a href="$prev_page">previous</a>
</div></textarea><p>
The Xyaptu templates are a lot more powerful than my hack, but the code didn't
turn out nearly as neat as I'd hoped. Furthermore, it meant embedding some
logic within the template, which I realized I had wanted to avoid. What seemed
so natural in my PHP days now feels awkward and forced.<p>
The final nail in Xyaptu's coffin came when I tested its speed against my 
simple &lt;photo&gt; tag hack. Xyaptu timed a reasonable .05 seconds to parse
this simple template, but my code did the same thing in an almost-nonexistent
.005 seconds. I don't attribute the difference to my coding ability, but
rather to the specific nature of my hack.<p>
I was able to customize Xyaptu fairly easily to replace unfound variables with
empty strings, and I even hacked it up so that it didn't add extra empty lines
to my code. It is short, simple, and reasonably fault tolerant. I also believe
that its performance would be adequate for a dynamic web application. It would
certainly add a lot of power to the gallery's templating system.<p>
However, in this case. I think my hack surpasses it for simplicity and 
elegance. The added power of Xyaptu is simply not worthwhile for the increased
complexity and learning curve it brings.<p>
If somebody would be interested in a Xyaptu template plugin 
for Pyblosxom, I would be glad to write it, since I did all kinds of work to
customize it for pyblosxom already. It seems to me, though, that it would be a
step backwards. If somebody would like a Cheetah plugin, they'll have to
write it themselves, because I don't feel that the program is fast enough to
power a dynamic website.<p>
I did not try any more template plugins, because seeing the results of such
plugins made me more satisfied with my current solution. The only
different, interesting, idea that came up in my template search is 
<a href="http://www.entrian.com/PyMeld/">PyMeld</a>.<p>
In PyMeld, you manipulate the HTML template directly from python, selecting
elements by ids which you must insert. I like the idea, but I don't want to
force the users of my photo gallery to be python programmers (even though
they're very likely to be anyway). It seems to me that PyMeld has the opposite
problem of PHP - it puts some of the display information inside the code of
the web application.<p>
<h2>Status of the gallery</h2><p>
I'm glad I didn't let anybody download it before today, since there was a bug
in it which was creating all kinds of extra thumbnails and medium images. I
found this out when my disk filled up, but it fortunately caused me no damage.
(I'm not that bad a programmer, I swear).<p>
I spent a couple of hours trying to
wrap <a href="http://home.arcor.de/ahuggel/exiv2/">exiv2</a> 
with <a href="http://www.swig.org/">Swig</a> so that I could use
it from python, but was unsuccessful. I still don't have a good meta-data
solution for photos, so if you have any ideas, let me know.<p>
<h2>Question</h2><p>
Has anybody actually used the keyword categorization on my site? Found it
useful? Found it broken? Thought about using it somewhere else?
