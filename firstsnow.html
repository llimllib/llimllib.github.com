        <h1>First Snow, and a debugging puzzle</h1>

        Well, last night it snowed for the first time this winter here (Connecticut,
USA). For most people, that's an unfortunate sign that it's getting cold, but
I love the winter. Snow is so austere and beautiful - it has a quiet quality
that I love. It's always an exciting day for me when it snows for the first
time. One of my ex-girlfriends said I had a "snow face" which only came out
when it snowed.<p>
Anyway, I've now become a developer for pyblosxom, as Will so kindly
<a href="http://www.bluesock.org/~willg/blog/dev/pyblosxom/billmilletal.html">pointed
out</a> in his blog. I hope that I'll be up to the task, and hope that we can
improve pyblosxom a lot. For right now, I'm hacking on meta-data, but I plan
to work on static rendering when I've got it in some form of working state.<p>
So, being a developer and all, I had to download the CVS source for pyblosxom
and run it, to see if my new plugins work with it. Fortunately, the keywords
and meta plugins ran with no changes and only one addition to config.py. I knew
that was too good to be true, though, and I was right.<p>
Once I had those working, I needed to see if the metatime plugin worked. Well,
it kinda works, and is presenting me with an interesting problem. At first,
nothing was working. However, after I inserted some debugging code, it started
working perfectly. The debugging code is as follows:<p>
<textarea cols="50" rows="4">###delete me
from tools import log
for l in data["entry_list"]:
    log("pyblox day: %s" % l['da'])</textarea><p>
Can you guess which part of this simple statement is the crucial one which 
causes everything to work all of a sudden? I couldn't either, so I tested it -
it's the <code>l['da']</code>. <code>l['mo']</code> has the same effect, 
but not just <code>l</code>. Something in __getitem__ must be causing the entry
to do... something. I haven't quite figured that out yet.<p>
<h2>Yet more on meta-data</h2><p>
So, as Will points out, pyblosxom needs some sort of meta-data database. I felt
that the way to store this information in the most pyblosxom-ish way was to
store it in the file in such a way that it can be ignored easily if necessary,
and then to be read into pickles if it's not going to be ignored. This, while
not an optimal solution, is at least a simple one, and that seems to be a tenet
of pyblosxom. It may be the most appealing aspect of pyblosxom for hackers
like me who like to be close to source code.<p>
What I wonder though, is, what are the solutions of other blogging packages?
I think that a relational database is way too complex for this type of
situation, so what's left? My original plan was just to simply leave the
meta-data inside the blog files, but that makes it difficult to search files
by their meta-data. If all the meta-data were in the files, you'd have to parse
every file to do a keyword search. With my system of files and parallel meta
files, it means unpickling a bunch of files, which (hopefully) is quite a bit
faster. I should benchmark this.<p>
Anyway, enough rambling, enjoy the winter weather if you get it, and listen to
