        <h1>The Interview</h1>

        Last week, I got called by a recruiter who found my resume on the
web. We talked a little bit, but I didn't expect anything to come of it. When
she didn't call me back on Friday, I expected more of the same today. However,
at 10 AM the phone rang, and you can guess who was on the line.<p> We met this
afternoon to talk about the job. I was nervous about the interview, but I
didn't have to be. Michelle, the recruiter, was very friendly and open about
what the position was and how I fit into it (and how I didn't). After our
interview, which took about an hour, she called up the employer and got me an
interview.<p>
The problem: the job requires PL/SQL, which I have only used in
the context of my one college database class, 2 years ago now. Since I was
researching at the time, I didn't think much of the class, and didn't pay a
whole lot of attention. Since the interview is Wednesday, today has become The
Day Of PL/SQL.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find my PL/SQL textbook (although I
found the other, utterly useless, textbook from that class) and I don't have an
Oracle server to connect to and test out statements. Hopefully, one day will be
long enough for a refresher course.<p>
I'm going to the <a
href="http://wesleyan.edu">Wesleyan</a> library in the morning to find a book
and study up. Their science library is an absolute gem 
- unlike my college's library was, theirs is overflowing with computer science
books.  Not only do they have academic, journal type books, but they have
general-purpose technology books galore. When I discovered the place, I
wandered around for 3 hours, just reading random books, and finding new
spots. I'm a geek.
