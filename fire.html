        <h1>Burn</h1>

        Today, my girlfriend and I bought a house. We needed to do so because, on the
night of December 4, grease in a pot I'd left on simmer in the house we were 
renting caught fire, exploded onto a nearby couch, and set my house on fire.<p>

<h2>Mutt</h2><p>

I woke up to the sound of my dog making weird half-barks towards the bedroom
door. Annoyed, I did the natural thing to do when your dog starts barking at
3:30 AM - yelled at her to shut up. When she didn't, I started to yell at her
again, until I noticed a sound.<p>

"Oh," I thought, "The fire alarm's going off."<p>

Thinking it was a faulty alarm, I opened the bedroom door, and immediately knew
things were wrong. A thin veil of smoke was lifted over my hallway, so I shut the
door, put on some clothes, and tried reopening the door. In the thirty seconds
it must have taken me to throw on some pants and a sweatshirt, that veil had
become a wall and blasted me in the face.<p>

"Shit shit shit shit shit.", I think was the only appropriate response. I was
now in action mode, so I took stock: Exits from the second story? None. Good
way to get my dog out? None. Girlfriend? At work. Dog? Freaked out, but
otherwise OK. Cell phone? check.<p>

Now I had something I could do, so I picked up the phone and called
911 while I knocked the screens out of the windows and stuck my head out. My
room was getting smoky now.<p>

I had barely gotten the address of the rowhouse out to the operator when I saw
my neighbor poke his head out of his house. He had come to see what was up,
since there were now 20-foot flames shooting out the back windows of my house.
This tends to make neighbors curious.<p>

"You - ", I shouted to my startled neighbor, " I need to get my dog out. Get
over here."<p>

"I - I - I need my glasses!", he yelled, and scurried back into his house.<p>

"Are there flames in the room you're in, sir?" repeated the 911 operator. I'd
forgotten all about her.<p>

"No, but it's fucking hot and smoky in here". I hadn't realized until I
responded angrily to the poor operator trying to help me that I was fighting a
rising tide of panic, and would need to calm down to make it out.<p>

After what seemed an age, my neighbor ran out of his house again, this time
with his glasses and, more importantly, his two roommates and a blanket. Before
I could think about how much I was in a '20s movie cliche, I had tossed my
45-pound mutt, scratching and clawing, out the bedroom window and into the 
blanket below.<p>

As I sat myself on the windowsill, trying to figure out the best way to hang
and fall without breaking anything, firetrucks raced around the corner. When I
told the firefighter who ran over to me that I was going to jump, he told me to
stop being stupid and wait for a ladder.<p>

A minute later, I was standing on the ground, watching 2 ladders full of
firefighters busting the crap out of my house.<p>

<h2>Aftermath</h2><p>

The support that all of my neighbors, whom I barely knew, offered my girlfriend
and I was truly humbling. She had been working an overnight shift, but I'd
paged her and she was back at the scene with me. We had a half dozen offers of
places to sleep, and people were taking turns trying to control my 9-month-old
pup for me while I wandered around in a daze.<p>

At about 5:00 that morning, two Red Cross volunteers came and visited us. They 
gave us a
$200 gift card so we could buy coats, made sure we had a place to stay, and
generally did a great job of calming us down and telling us stories of similar
situations. I owe a debt of gratitude to the two elderly volunteers who came at
such a crazy early time of day, and treated us with respect and caring while we
were clearly both out of our minds. I used to dislike donating to the Red Cross
because it felt faceless and too big; I won't ever feel that way again.<p>

The weirdest part of the whole experience came a few hours later, when I went
to the grocery store before our insurance adjuster came over. I walked into the
Safeway, where I'd been a thousand times before, but stopped just after the
entrance. I was blown away by the <b>stuff</b> - so much <b>stuff</b>, and I
suddenly had nothing.<p>

My face was still covered in soot, I smelled like chemical fire, and I was
wearing the
only two articles of clothing I still owned. I felt like an alien on planet
yuppie, suddenly much different from all of the people around me.<p>

What do you buy in the grocery store when all you owned has just been
incinerated? I suspect the answer varies, but for me it was Wheat Thins, warm
caps for myself and my girl, dog food, and coffee.<p>

Finally, around 9:00, the insurance adjuster came and wrote us a preliminary
$3000 check. This is the point in the story where I implore everyone who reads 
this to go
get renters' insurance if you don't have it - it saved our butts. $120 in
insurance is likely to shortly pay us about $22,000 - a better investment is
impossible to imagine.<p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2><p>

First off, definitely make sure you have renter's insurance. If we hadn't had 
it, I don't know what we would have done. I spent a lot of time after the fire 
wondering what a person with less income than us and no renter's insurance 
would do - they'd be completely devestated.<p>

Second, turn your damn stove off.<p>

Last, I can't express how thankful I am for all the help that we have received 
since the fire. At times, it's been overwhelming how much everyone wants to 
help us. I'm something of a solitary person, and I've had to get used to people 
giving me things. It's really made me appreciate what people go through in a 
disaster, especially people who don't have many resources to fall back on.<p>
