        <h1>Del.icio.us-style keyword blogging</h1>

        I have completed working prototype plugin for keyword blogging. You will see,
at the bottom of any blog article, a list of keywords similar to what you
might see on <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. If you try clicking
on one of the links, you should be brought to a page with all entries
containing that keyword.<p>
I hope that this will provide an easier method for browsing blog entries;
instead of being rigidly categorized, I hope that they'll be more browseable
and interconnected. There are interesting possibilities for graphing the
connections, and keeping statistics on connections, but for right now I'm just
happy that it's working.<p>
<h2>Implementation</h2><p>
It took me just over a day to implement my keyword plugin, and there was only
one major snafu that required me to write some, well, "interesting" code.
Throughout the process of writing the plugin, I have become more and more 
impressed with the way that pyblosxom is coded. Its infinite configureability
makes anything possible; more complicated things just mean that you have to
rewrite more of the engine.<p>
The first thing that I had to decide was the encoding of the keywords. Since
pyblosxom blogs are simply text files uploaded to the server, it didn't make
sense to enter the metadata separately. Since they were in the text file, and
I needed them to not render with the HTML of a blog, I decided to put them in
a comment within the blog. With my plugin, any line beginning with 
"&lt;!--keywords:" and ending with "--&gt;" is a tag line.<p>
The first step in getting my plugin working was to get a story to display
its own keywords. To do this, I simply overrode cb_story (the hook which is
called right before a story is rendered), parsed the file for keyword lines,
and set any keywords equal to the $keywords pyblosxom variable. They could
then be displayed in the article simply by referencing the variable $keywords.
<p>
Because I needed each keyword to be a link to a keyword search for itself, and
because the simple pyblosxom templating language can only display a single
variable, I had two choices. I could either extend the templating language
to include function calls or iteration, or I could simply make the whole
sequence of links right there in the cb_story function. For now, I've done the
latter, since it was simpler.<p>
Once I had the keywords displaying, the next step was to make it possible
to search for a keyword. No problem - I'll just override the cb_pathinfo hook,
and if there's a "/keyword/" starting the URL, take control of the selection
of files to be displayed.<p>
Once I'd gotten searching for the "/keyword/" part of the URL down, I realized
that I had a major problem. How could I find the keywords when they were
buried in the blog files themselves? Searching through all the text of all
the blogs didn't seem like a sensible solution, but there was no easy way to
implement a new piece of metadata for each file. I was stuck.<p>
After thinking about how to implement the metadata for a while, I decided that
it was important enough that it deserved a general solution. After all, there
are lots of possibly interesting bits of data about a blog entry - keywords,
category, comments, trackbacks, and lots of other possibilities. So the meta
module came into being.<p>
The meta module, right now, simply mirrors each "*.txt" file with a "*.meta"
file. Inside the meta file is a 
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-pickle.html">pickled</a>
dictionary representing keywords of the "*.txt" entry. If the meta file already
exists, the module simply loads that and does no parsing of the blog entry.
In the future, I would like it to be a more general solution to the problem
of metadata. I intend to implement, at the least, a new comments module
using it.<p>
Since the meta module loads up its information (hopefully quickly) right at the
cb_start hook, which is called on plugin initialization, it makes enough
information about each blog entry available that keyword searching is easy. I
now simply scan through the meta information dictionary of each file and see
if the requested keyword is present. If it is, the file is included for
rendering, and if not, it's excluded.<p>
And that's what I spent the last day and a half doing. Hopefully somebody
will find it worthwhile, but I know that I learned an awful lot doing it. I
will release my code in a couple of days, when I know that it works and I've
set it up a little more generally. If you're interested in it, please leave
a comment or drop me an <a href="mailto:llimllib@f2o.org">email</a> with
suggestions or flames.
