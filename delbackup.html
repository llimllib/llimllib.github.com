        <h1>Backup del.icio.us to Gmail</h1>

        I love <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, and <a
href="http://del.icio.us/llimllib">I have saved</a>, as of right now, 362 links
with it. However, I've always had one problem with it - it doesn't save a copy
of the webpage I link to. I've always thought this would be handy, so I could
search through my bookmarked pages; sometimes I can't remember what tags I gave
to an article.<p>

Since they have a publicly available <a
href="http://del.icio.us/doc/api">API</a>, I thought I would write a simple
script to scrape all the pages and dump the backup on my hard drive. However,
since I have 2 computers, that wouldn't help me much. Being stubborn, I wrote
the script anyway, and wondered how I would use it. Finally a light came on -
why not just upload the pages to my gmail account, where I can search them from
any computer?<p>
A couple hours later, the script was <a
href="http://billmill.org/static/files/delicious_backup.py">done</a>, and all my
bookmarks were searchable on gmail. I was initially stumped by my inability to
get <a href="http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/">libgmail</a> working, before I
found out that gmail had enabled SMTP access. For continually surpassing
expectations, I raise my glass to <a
href="http://gmail.google.com">Gmail</a>.<p>
If you want the script, and you didn't read the previous link, get it <a
href="http://billmill.org/static/files/delicious_backup.py">here</a>. There is an
extensive docstring.<p>
Thanks to <a

Preston</a>, whose funk powered the creation of this script.
