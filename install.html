        <h1>How I Installed Pyblosxom</h1>

        Recently, I installed pyblosxom. Despite my concerns about its 
unpronounceability, I'm very happy with it, and I hope to put some interesting
hacks on it soon. For now, though, I'll just list how I installed it. I'll
try to keep it brief, so if you have any questions,
<a href="mailto:wimill@ursinus.edu">drop me a line</a>.<p>
My server is graciously hosted by <a href="http://f2o.org">f2o</a>, and I only
have FTP access to it. It already was well set up for Python CGI, so I was able
to skip that part of the process.<p>
The first thing I did, naturally, was pick up the most recent pyblosxom at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67445">sourceforge</a>, 
version 1.0 in my case. I then extracted the tar file into its own
directory, using my own
<a href="http://billmill.org/static/files/extract.py">extract</a>
script.<p>
Once I had the program downloaded and extracted, my next task was to upload
the necessary directories to my web server. I made a blog/ directory and
copied the Pyblosxom/ and web/ directories to it. I edited the web/config.py
file on my local machine, simply answering the questions that it asked me,
and updated the copy on my FTP server. I then loaded up the pyblosxom.cgi
script in my browser, and saw that it appeared to be working correctly.<p>
Next, I wanted to put the pyblosxom.cgi script in a more convenient place and
rename it to something better than pyblosxom.cgi. I moved the file down into
the blog/ directory, and called it "serve". Remember that when you move this
file, you'll have to move config.py into the same directory. 
To make sure that Apache parsed
serve as a cgi file, I created a .htaccess file, and added a few other
options to it.
<h2>.htaccess</h2>
<textarea cols="50" rows="10">
#load the "serve" page by default
DirectoryIndex serve

#don't let anyone read my "config.py"
&lt;Files config.py>
    deny from all
&lt;/Files>

#force "serve" to be a python file
&lt;Files serve>
ForceType application/cgi-script
SetHandler cgi-script
&lt;/Files>
</textarea><p>
To test the installation, I created a file called "test.txt" with a few lines
of text in it, and put it in the blog directory. Since the blog directory was
also my data directory (as I specified in config.py), pyblosxom should display
the text of the file as a blog entry, and it did.<p>
<h2>Creating my flavour</h2><p>
The next task was to match the blog design to my existing website's design.
This was the part I was dreading, as most software packages require you to
learn their arcane templating language. Pyblosxom, instead, does things exactly
the way I do for my own site.<p>
I copied the *.html files from the contrib/flavour_examples/ directory to the
main blog directory. Inside the head.html file, I put the HTML I already had 
for my header. Inside the foot.html file, I did the same thing. Finally, I
altered the story.html file so that it used the same CSS styles as the rest
of the site, and added some cosmetic changes.<p>
And that was it! This method is remarkably similar to how I already generate
the static HTML for my web pages. I wrote a very simple pre-processing system
in python which includes a generic header and footer into each page, and each
page simply defines its body. Thus, it was a piece of cake to integrate
Pyblosxom into my own site.<p>
Finally, I added comments to my site. This time, however, I was able to use
exactly the instructions provided in the README, so I'll spare you the grungy
details of the process.<p>
And that was it! I had a fully functional pyblosxom which was integrated into
my own site. As I said before, I was pretty excited about the ease with which
I was able to get it installed, and by how easy it is to understand. I plan
to add <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>-style labels to my blog,
so I'll add updates on pyblosxom's hackability later.
