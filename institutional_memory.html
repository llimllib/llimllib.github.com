        <h1>What Gladwell is Missing: Institutional Memory</h1>

        <p>Malcolm Gladwell's recent <a
href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/11/090511fa_fact_gladwell?yrail">article</a>,
ostensibly about how Davids can beat Goliaths, featured great praise for the
full-court press as a method for less-skilled teams to beat more-skilled ones.
He writes:

<blockquote>In the world of basketball, there is one story after another like
this about legendary games where David used the full-court press to beat
Goliath. Yet the puzzle of the press is that it has never become popular.
People look at upsets like Fordham over UMass and call them flukes. Basketball
sages point out that the press can be beaten by a well-coached team with adept
ball handlers and astute passers&mdash;and that is true... Playing insurgent
basketball did not guarantee victory. It was simply the best chance an underdog
had of beating Goliath.</blockquote>

a long and interesting email conversation between him and Bill Simmons that
addressed the criticism. In it, Gladwell defended his column:

<blockquote>After my piece ran in <em>The New Yorker</em>, one of the most common
responses I got was people saying, well, the reason more people don't use the
press is that it can be beaten with a well-coached team and a good point guard.
That is (A) absolutely true and (B) beside the point. The press doesn't
guarantee victory. It simply represents the underdog's best  chance of
victory&hellip; I went to see a Lakers-Warriors game earlier this season, and
it was abundantly clear after five minutes that the Warriors' chances of
winning were, oh, no better than 10 percent. Why wouldn't you have a special
squad of trained pressers come in for five minutes a half and press Kobe and
Fisher?&hellip;  Best case is that you rattle the Lakers and force
a half-dozen extra turnovers that turn out to be crucial. And if you lose, so
what? You were going to lose anyway.</blockquote>

<p>Although lots of people have responded to this rebuttal, I haven't seen
anyone mention what I consider to be an important reason that many teams have
chosen not to implement full-court presses: <strong>Institutional
Memory</strong>.

<p>Let's imagine that the Warriors had in fact, put on the press, and that it
had worked. The Warriors won against the vaunted Lakers! How would the team
respond? They would press more. When that worked to win some more games, they would
probably trade some of their players who were less well suited to the press to
make room for some younger, faster, fitter players. They would win a few more
games than they had been before. Everything's going good, right?

<p>Then they hit a snag; <strong>No team has won the NBA Championship by pressing
</strong>. The Warriors could optimize like crazy for the press, but
they'd be training and working and trading and drafting to be, at best, a
pretty good team. But no NBA team wants to be a pretty good team&mdash;they all
want to win championships.

<p>The mental exercise reveals what Gladwell has missed: the Warriors aren't
playing to win that game, or even the most games that season. They're playing
to try and win an NBA championship,
and to do so, they need to spend years trying to build up the institutional
memory of how to win games in the traditional way so that they can eventually beat
every team, not just to win more games than they did playing traditionally.

<p>All of this leads to a simple admonishment when analyzing organizations:
don't expect that the organization is optimizing for what you think they're
optimizing for. And when an organization seems to be acting in ways that are surprising to
you, look for metrics that may be more important to them than the ones you
expect.
