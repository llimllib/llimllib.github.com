* timing
  * took me about 2:30 to do "why" and iPhone slide
  * took me about 10:00 to do other 8 slides
* add some style
  * gradient demo (2 wheels. unnecessary?)
* text
  * whu-oh: talk about the problems with text
* images
  * import a background image?
* better title
* more slides in the presentation
* practice
* possibly too technical topics:
    * talk about what push() and pop() mean?
    * what paths mean?
