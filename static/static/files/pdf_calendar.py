"""Create a PDF calendar.

This script requires Python and Reportlab
( http://reportlab.org/rl_toolkit.html ). Tested only with Python 2.4 and
Reportlab 1.2.

See bottom of file for an example of usage. No command-line interface has been
added, but it would be trivial to do so. Furthermore, this script is pretty
hacky, and could use some refactoring, but it works for what it's intended
to do.
